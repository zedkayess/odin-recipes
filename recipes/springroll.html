    <h2>Method</h2></div>
    <div class="method"><p>
        <ol>
            <li>To make the dipping sauce: Combine mango, ginger, chili sauce, rice vinegar, and lime juice in a blender and blend until smooth. Add basil and cilantro and pulse until chopped. Pour into a small bowl, then cover and place in the refrigerator until serving.</li>
            <li>To make the spring rolls: Squeeze a little lime juice over avocado slices. Create an assembly line of vegetables and herbs, so that they are all ready to go</li>
            <li>Fill a shallow dish with warm water. Add rice paper sheet to warm water, one at a time, and let soak for 5 to 10 seconds. Remove and place on a flat surface. Toward one end of the rice wrapper, begin layering with 1 to 2 avocado slices, small handfuls of fresh cilantro and mint, and a handful of veggies. Sprinkle veggies with salt and pepper. Fold both ends to the center and roll sheet as tightly as possible without ripping. Place each prepared spring roll on a serving platter and cover with aluminum foil to keep spring rolls from drying out.</li>
            <li> Continue with remaining ingredients, adding them to the platter as you work. Keep the spring rolls covered with foil at all times.</li>
            <li>Serve the spring rolls with the mango dipping sauce and optional chopped peanuts.</li>
        </ol>
