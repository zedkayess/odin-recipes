        </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <p>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9 x 13-inch baking pan.</li>
                <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook 9 lasagne noodles in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain.</li>
                <li>While the noodles are cooking, heat oil in a Dutch oven over medium heat. Add both mushrooms and onion; cook and stir until tender, around 5 to 7 minutes.</li>
                <li>Add parsley, garlic, and Italian seasoning; cook for 2 minutes longer. Add wine; cook and stir until liquid has evaporated, 3 to 5 minutes. Add tomatoes and cook until heated through, about 5 minutes.</li>
                <li>Spread the sauce in the bottom of the prepared pan. Layer with 3 noodles, 1 1/3 cups sauce, and a scant amount of mozzarella and Parmesan cheeses. Repeat with the next 2 layers.</li>
                <li>Combine cream, milk, and remaining mozzarella and Parmesan in a small bowl. Spoon over the lasagne.</li>
                <li>Cover and bake in the preheated oven for 30 minutes. Uncover and bake until cheese is melted, about 10 minutes longer. Let stand 10 minutes before serving.</li>
            </ol>
